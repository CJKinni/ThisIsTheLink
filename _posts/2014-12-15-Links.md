### Introduction

This is a test run of This is the Link.  I'm trying to figure out the optimal workflow for sorting through the most interesting stories each day.  The site aims to take the place of the recently closed [TabDump](http://www.tabdump.com).

I come from a different perspective &mdash; a law student, developer, and gamer interested in business and global politics.

Over the next few days, expect a variety of formats.  I'm playing with both conntent and design.  I'm considering whether there should be a consistent order and headings, deciding on length of each summary, and finding the number of articles I can post each day.

If you have any suggestions, send me a message on Twitter.  You can reach me at [@CKinniburgh](http://www.twitter.com/ckinniburgh).

### World

[Sydney CBD siege: hostages forced to hold black and white Islamic flag](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2014/dec/15/sydney-siege-reports-of-hostage-situation-inside-martin-place-cafe-live) &mdash; Hostages are being held inside a Sydney cafe.  My thoughts are with the hostages and their families.

[Uber reaches 4.0x surge pricing as Sydney faces hostage lockdown](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/xxky2QRxpwk/story01.htm) &mdash; Uber's automated 'surge pricing' means that when everyone wants to flea a city after a hostage situation, fares skyrocket.  Uber subsequently made rides out of Sydney free and claims to be refunding customers.

[Hong Kong police clear last pro-democracy protest site](http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/De8ZXbF4Xss/story01.htm) &mdash; After protests have blocked off streets for months, the last protesters refusing to move have been arrested, and the sites have been cleared.

[Provincial Russia feels economic squeeze](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30436200#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa) &mdash; With the country nearing a recession, the economic crisis is being felt in provincial Russia.

### Culture

[Norway's Slow TV Revolution](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/wait-for-it-norways-slow-tv-revolution/) &mdash; There is a slow-growing trend in Norway:  people are watching hours long television programming featuring mundane activities like knitting, train trips, and fire burning.

[Aaron Sorkin: Journalists Shouldn’t Help Criminals](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/opinion/aaron-sorkin-journalists-shouldnt-help-the-sony-hackers.html?ref=opinion&_r=0) &mdash; "At least the hackers are doing it for a cause. The press is doing it for a nickel."

[Hackers promise “Christmas present” Sony Pictures won’t like](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/hackers-promise-christmas-present-sony-pictures-wont-like/) &mdash; The 'Guardians of Peace,' the group who have distributed a terabyte of Sony Pictures Entertainment's confidential information, have released another message through Pastebin, promising more leaks in the coming days.

[Sony demands media delete 'stolen' data from hacked emails](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/business/sony-pictures-demands-that-news-organizations-delete-stolen-data.html) &mdash; A lawyer working with Sony is positioning the studio for a potential legal conflict if news organizations fail to destroy "stolen information."  This seems like a bluff, Sony's standing on shaky legal ground and the last thing they need is to remind the public about this hack over years-long legal disputes with media outlets.

### Law and Politics

[Backing CIA, Cheney Revisits Torture Debate From Bush Era](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/us/politics/cheney-senate-report-on-torture.html) &mdash; "“I would do it again in a minute."  Cheney's do-anything-to-succeed attitude is repulsive. He seems incapable of acknowledging the negative effects of torture and wrongful detention on both international relations and the moral underpinning of America.

[Andy Borowitz: ‘Dick Cheney Calls for International Ban on Torture Reports’](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cheney-calls-international-ban-torture-reports) &mdash; Sometimes humor is the only way to deal with the pain.

[Uber has an army of at least 161 lobbyists and they're crushing regulators](http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/14/7390395/uber-lobbying-steamroller) &mdash; Some of Uber's decisions seem sleazy, but for a company growing as quickly as they are, they make many smart business decisions.  This is one.

[Supreme Court to test its Spidey-Sense in Patent-Antitrust Case](http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/12/supreme-patent-antitrust.html) &mdash; The Supreme Court granted cert to *Kimble v. Marvel Enterprises*, which will determine whether a patent license may include royalty agreements stretching beyond the expiration of a patent.  Currently, they cannot.

### Tech 

[Locals upset at Google's Waze for sending traffic to their streets](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/cnet/tcoc/~3/2WVReYXfNeA/story01.htm) &mdash; Local residents are fighting back by sending fake accident reports to Waze.

[Yes, we work hard these days, but we work a lot less than we used to](http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/14/yes-we-work-hard-these-days-but-we-work-a-lot-less-than-we-used-to/) &mdash; Looking at working hours since 1870, you can see a significant decrease in working hours.

### Business

[General Mills Whips Yoplait Into Shape](http://online.wsj.com/articles/general-mills-whips-yoplait-into-shape-1418609154?mod=rss_whats_news_us) &mdash; Yoplait is making a comeback after the Greek-yogurt craze.

[BuzzFeed is killing it, and its older rivals are rattled](http://qz.com/310104/buzzfeed-is-killing-it-and-its-older-rivals-are-rattled/) &mdash; News Corp's CEO is sounding threatened by BuzzFeed: "We are going through a phase of the popularization of so-called journalism, which is a phase,” he said. “Anyone can attract traffic, but there is trash traffic, and there is real traffic.”

### Science

[Physics World Magazine names 2014 Breakthrough of the Year](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2014/12/14/physics-world-magazine-names-2014-breakthrough-of-the-year/) &mdash; The comet landing. Take a minute to appreciate the amazing [path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktrtvCvZb28) Rosetta took from leaving earth to landing.

[The audacious rescue plan that might have saved space shuttle Columbia](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/the-audacious-rescue-plan-that-might-have-saved-space-shuttle-columbia/1/) &mdash; I need this movie.

### Games

[PlayStation Plus gave away more than $1,300 in free games in 2014](http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/13/7387279/playstation-plus-gave-away-more-than-1300-in-free-games-in-2014) &mdash; While Sony Pictures is being recently hacked, Sony's Playstation Network is soaring after the devistating 2011 hack.
